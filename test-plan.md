# Test Plan for Calculator Module

## Introduction
This test plan is designed to verify the functionality of the provided calculator module, which includes functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The goal is to ensure that each arithmetic operation performs as expected, including proper error handling for division by zero.

## Test Objectives
- Validate the correct functionality of the `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` functions.
- Ensure that all edge cases are handled, including operations with negative and decimal numbers, and division by zero.

## Test Scope
- **In Scope:**
  - Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  - Handling of edge cases:
    - Positive numbers.
    - Negative numbers.
    - Decimal numbers.
    - Division by zero.
- **Out of Scope:**
  - UI testing and advanced mathematical functions.

## Test Strategy
- **Unit Testing:** Each function will have at least three test cases to cover typical scenarios and edge cases.
- **Framework:** The Jest testing framework will be used to automate and execute the tests.

## Test Cases

### Addition Function (`add`)
- **Case 1:** Add two positive numbers.
- **Case 2:** Add a negative and a positive number.
- **Case 3:** Add two decimal numbers (use `toBeCloseTo`).

### Subtraction Function (`subtract`)
- **Case 1:** Subtract two positive numbers.
- **Case 2:** Subtract a larger number from a smaller number resulting in a negative value.
- **Case 3:** Subtract two decimal numbers (use `toBeCloseTo`).

### Multiplication Function (`multiply`)
- **Case 1:** Multiply two positive numbers.
- **Case 2:** Multiply a negative and a positive number.
- **Case 3:** Multiply two decimal numbers.
- **Case 4:** Multiply any number by zero.

### Division Function (`divide`)
- **Case 1:** Divide two positive numbers.
- **Case 2:** Divide a negative and a positive number.
- **Case 3:** Divide two decimal numbers (use `toBeCloseTo`).
- **Case 4:** Divide by zero (should throw an error using `toThrow`).

## Risk Analysis
- **Division by Zero:** Improper handling of division by zero could crash the application.
- **Decimal Calculations:** Potential floating point inaccuracies in decimal arithmetic.

## Test Environment
- Node.js and npm installed.
- Jest testing framework.
