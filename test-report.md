- ✅ **Adds -1 + (-2) to equal -3**
- ✅ **Adds 0.1 + 0.2 to be close to 0.3**

### Subtraction
- ✅ **Subtracts 5 - 3 to equal 2**
- ✅ **Subtracts -5 - (-3) to equal -2**
- ✅ **Subtracts 0.5 - 0.2 to be close to 0.3**

### Multiplication
- ✅ **Multiplies 2 * 3 to equal 6**
- ✅ **Multiplies -2 * 3 to equal -6**
- ✅ **Multiplies 0.1 * 0.2 to be close to 0.02**
- ✅ **Multiplies 5 * 0 to equal 0**

### Division
- ✅ **Divides 6 / 3 to equal 2**
- ✅ **Divides -6 / 3 to equal -2**
- ❌ **Divides 0.6 / 0.2 to equal 3 (Failed)**
- ✅ **Throws error when dividing by zero**

## Failed Test Analysis
### Test Case: `divides 0.6 / 0.2 to equal 3`
- **Expected:** `3`
- **Received:** `2.9999999999999996`
- **Issue:** This failure is caused by floating-point precision errors in JavaScript, where some decimal calculations do not yield perfectly expected results.
- **Resolution:** Instead of using `toBe(3)`, we should use `toBeCloseTo(3, number_of_decimal_places)` to handle floating-point precision.

### Suggested Fix:
```javascript
test('divides 0.6 / 0.2 to be close to 3', () => {
  expect(divide(0.6, 0.2)).toBeCloseTo(3, 5);
});
```

## Conclusion
The calculator module functions correctly for most test cases, except for floating-point precision issues in division. The failing test can be fixed by adjusting the assertion method. Overall, the module meets the expected functionality for basic arithmetic operations, including proper handling of division by zero.
